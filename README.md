# Basic-ML-using-Tensorflow

This repository will we updated with basic ML problems which I am doing as a part of learning **Tensorflow**.

1) Linear-Regression: Predicting CO2 emission from a car given its engine size, number of cylinders and Fuel type.
   The dataset was taken from https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64 .
   The accuracy is quite bad because I had given no time for feature selection. Will be improved using neural networks.
   
2) Linear-Regression with Normal Eqn: Used Normal Equation instead of Gradient Descent and acheived a better result.
   
3) K-Mean Clustering Algo - I have uploaded 2 screenshots for K=7 and K=3. Works quite accurately.

4) Digit recognition using MNIST Dataset(NN.py) - Used a neural network with 2 hidden layers and achieved 96% accuracy.
